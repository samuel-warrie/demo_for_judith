  # Add products table to real-time publication

  1. Real-time Configuration
    - Add `products` table to the `supabase_realtime` publication
    - This enables real-time updates for product changes
    - Required for WebSocket-based live updates in the frontend

  2. Security
    - Ensure public users can receive real-time updates for products
    - This is safe since products are already publicly readable

  3. Notes
    - After this migration, the products table will appear in Database â†’ Publications
    - Real-time updates should work immediately without page refresh
    - Changes to products will be pushed to all connected clients
